To define a path in React, you need to download react-router-dom

On cmd, "npm i react-router-dom"

In App.js (Homepage), type "import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';"

Enclose home page with 

<Route exact path="/" render ={props => (
    <React.Fragment>
        {/*HOMEPAGE CONTENT HERE*/}
    </React.Fragment>
)} />

Enclose other pages with

Example: About

<Route path="/about" component={About} />

To link to those routes, on Header.js type

import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to="/"> Home</Link>
<Link to="/about"> About </Link>
