                    earn points from being active in the community. These points can be redeemed for weekly prizes and gifts.
                    Users will be able to sign up for ParkAway. This allows other users to view their profile, and give them the 
                    ability to leave updates and comments.</p>

                <p class="pspacing">Community input is the key to making ParkAway effective. It shows users the states of parking lots and 
                    it also results in ParkAway having an effect on the community. People can get involved and show their 
                    commitment in the community.</p>

<h1>
 About Us   
</h1>
    <p> 
        We are a group of students studying CST at BCIT. We are developing the ParkAway app for our Projects course. 
        We were inspired to create this app because parking at BCIT is an issue that we faced in our own group. The
        app will use crowdsourcing and community input to show users the states of parking lots. Users can also add their
        own input about the states of parking lots.

        Our Vision
    </h1>
    <p>
        We are striving to create a better experience for the students and staff at BCIT with our ParkAway Web Application.
        ParkAway will give users a faster and easier way of finding a place to park.
