          We are a group of students studying CST at BCIT. We are developing the
          ParkAway app for our Projects course. We were inspired to create this
          app because parking at BCIT is an issue that we faced in our own group.
        </p>
        <!-- Top paragraph and its spacing from the top -->
        <p class="pspacing">
          The app will use crowdsourcing and community input to show users the states
          of parking lots. Users can also add their own input about the states of
          parking lots
        </p>
        <!-- The spacing between each paragraph form top and bottom -->
        <p class="pspacing">
          During our first week of classes for COMP 2930, we would always talk about
          how it was taking us so long to find a place to park. Even if we found a
          spot, then it would take 15 minutes just to walk to class. We felt like their
          should be a better way and decided to create the ParkAway web app. We wanted
          staff and students to all have a resolution to this daily issue and with community
          input, it would be the perfect oppurtunity to get the staff and students of BCIT
          involved.
