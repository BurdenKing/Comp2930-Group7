 About Us   
</h1>
    <p> 
        We are a group of students studying CST at BCIT. We are developing the ParkAway app for our Projects course. 
        We were inspired to create this app because parking at BCIT is an issue that we faced in our own group. The
        app will use crowdsourcing and community input to show users the states of parking lots. Users can also add their
        own input about the states of parking lots.
